# How to run tests (TODO - pending)

-   Run `npm run test` to execute `react-scripts test`

# Development strategy

A more detailed explained on the steps I've taken to go about the development of the application.  
[Link to the file DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

# Tips

-   [x] Write a good README with basic information (e.g.: how to start the project and how to build it);
-   [] There's no screens designed for the mobile version, but if you build a responsive app it's a big plus. We would love to see your design skills as well!
-   [] Feel free to work and improve on the available designs. Think of them as guidelines.
-   [] There's a "like" button on the details page. It would be great if this information is persistent!
    -   I was going to use `localStorage` to save users' "preferences". But due to the time constraint I've skipped.
-   [x] Prefer to use a css methodology, such as BEM, ITCSS, etc;
-   [x] Use any CSS extension like LESS or SASS;
    -   I've used MaterialUI instead.
-   [x] Asking questions is good. We will not penalize you for asking questions;
    -   Didn't have enough time to ask questions.
    -   I'd ask questions on if whether there's a need to have this application deployed with (Dev, Staging, QA, and Production) environments.
-   [] The API server is sometimes slow, so think about loading and empty states throughout your application;
    -   Just handled asynchronous calls
-   [] We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
-   [] Unit testing will be greatly valued;
    -   Couldn't expand much on this due to the time.
-   [x] The git history will be evaluated;
-   [x] Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, elegance (among other factors);
